Presents mathematical methods for (i) modeling civil infrastructure systems, (ii) estimating system states from sensor data, and (iii) controlling system dynamics. Topics include differential equation-based models of civil infrastructure; time and frequency domain representations; linear spaces and linear operators; state-space models; modal analysis; controllability and observability; feedback control; state estimation; and system identification. Three lecture hours a week for one semester.
